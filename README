This is an application written in php and jquery that allows a person to authenticate multiple twitter identities into a single profile, which then allows them to perform a variety of actions such as scheduling tweets, auto responding to direct messages, and other tasks.

The purpose of this is to help people more effectively run marketing campaigns by allowing them to automate numerous social media behaviors.

This works on linux and utilizes cron to run scheduled jobs at periodic times.

You'd need to set up linux cron jobs on the different files named _events.  So daily_events.php should run once a day, hourly_events.php run every hour, minute_events.php run ever minute etc.

This application uses jquery as the underlying framework for a majority of the javascript.
